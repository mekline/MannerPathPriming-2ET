#MPP with an eyetracker!

Unlike original MPP, MPP-2ET has been refactored so that common code for psychtoolbox and the Tobii are in a shared library with other extensions (like MPP-Concepts!). MPP-2ET doesn't currently run. 

The necessary libraries (to put in the RESOURCEFOLDER path) are at:

PTB-Helper: https://github.com/mekline/PTB_HelperFuns

Tobii-PsychToolBox: https://github.com/mekline/Tobii-PsychToolBox

Also put the audio, movies, and stars folders in RESOURCEFOLDER
